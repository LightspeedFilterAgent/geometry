    <h1>Welcome to the World of Geometry</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction to Geometry</h2>
    <p>Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, sizes, properties, and dimensions of objects in space. It plays a crucial role in various fields, from architecture to physics.</p>
    
    <h2>Types of Geometry</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Euclidean Geometry:</strong> This is the traditional geometry developed by Euclid. It deals with flat surfaces and is based on axioms, theorems, and postulates.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Euclidean Geometry:</strong> In contrast to Euclidean geometry, this branch explores geometries on curved surfaces and includes hyperbolic and elliptic geometries.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytic Geometry:</strong> This involves using algebraic methods to study geometry, often in the context of coordinate systems and equations.</li>
        <li><strong>Differential Geometry:</strong> It focuses on the study of curves and surfaces, applying principles from calculus to understand their properties.</li>
        <li><strong>Projective Geometry:</strong> This branch explores properties that are preserved under projective transformations, crucial in computer graphics and computer vision.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Geometry in Everyday Life</h2>
    <p>Geometry is all around us, from the shapes of buildings to the patterns in nature. Understanding the various types of geometry helps us comprehend the world we live in.</p>
